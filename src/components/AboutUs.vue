                     Ward Admin: Ward administrators have full control over the management of players, coaches,
                     and
                     managers within their wards. They can add new profiles, edit existing information, search

                     specific players or coaches, and even create teams. They also have the ability to view,
                     delete,
                     and update player records, ensuring that all data is kept up to date and organized.

                     for
                     creating separate municipality-level teams, made up of top players from various wards, to
